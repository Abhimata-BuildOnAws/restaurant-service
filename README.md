# Restaurant Service for Tumpang

## Features
Order Service allows users to browse restaurant, and their respective menu items. It features functionality like allowing Restaurant users to create their restaurant and add their own menu items. 

Browsing restaurant also features the functionality to calculate absolute distance and travel distance between the user and the restaurant. This is translated to pollution that could be emitted due to the delivery for a more informed decision by the user.
